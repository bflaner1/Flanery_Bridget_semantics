                <h2>Welcome to Chef YumYum!</h2>

                <p>Chef YumYum is a new meal service that offers more
                than just recipes. Of course, you can start by choosing our recipe-only
                service, and tell us your favorite ingredients and foods so that we can
                suggest a meal plan for you that will include the healthiest and most
                delicious things for you and your family, but we have many other options
                as well! Choose from our prepared meal ingredients kits or from our
                fully-prepared and cooked meals delivered to your door by local drivers.</p>

                <p>Our company began as a small, chef-run concept with the belief that we
                could help our friends feed their families the food that they loved, in
                the time that they had, without needing to be professionally trained as
                chefs. We worked together performing research for three years, first with
                our friends and family, them with other locals, then across the country,
                to make sure that we understood the needs of our audience. We want you to
                love what you eat!</p>

                <p>Chef YumYum is small but mighty, and we are here to
                help! You can find free recipes here on our site to get you started, and
                to give you an idea of what we offer our customers. We want you to feel
                like family, and our family eats <em>very</em> well. YumYum!</p>
